<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Project Summary

You can see 3 types main subfolder as Design Sources, Constraints and Simulation Sources. It' s clearly understandable that our design is instantiated by simulation file Testbench.

### Built With
This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.
* [Vivado](https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado.html)
* [Basys 3](https://store.digilentinc.com/basys-3-artix-7-fpga-beginner-board-recommended-for-introductory-users/)
* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com)


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Multiplexer logic
This is an example of how design up down counter 8 bit in a FPGA.

### To clone project
Clone the repo
